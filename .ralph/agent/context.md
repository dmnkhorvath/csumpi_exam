## Notes

This is a worktree-based parallel loop. The following resources are symlinked
to the main repository:

- `.ralph/agent/memories.md` → shared memories
- `.ralph/specs/` → shared specifications
- `.ralph/tasks/` → shared code task files

Local state (scratchpad, runtime tasks, events) is isolated to this worktree.
