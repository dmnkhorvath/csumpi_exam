## Next Session

Session completed successfully. No pending work.

**Original objective:**

```
add a new category on the page called 'Latin' among all questions search for question text where text contains 'latin' in any regexp combination. List only those questions on this page. Validate it through chromemcp once validation is success commit and push changes to remote
for the app server use a different port bc that is already in use on the machine, do this port change only for development time but not when you are pushing it to remote
```
