## Next Session

Session completed successfully. No pending work.

**Original objective:**

```
in a separate worktree implement search input that is sticky and always visible on category pages where questions are listed, on user input filter rendered questions
for the app server use a different port bc that is already in use on the machine, do this port change only for development time but not when you are pushing it to remote
```
