It has two main parts, one is procesing large amount of pdf files, chunk them up by questions, find similarity groups in order to do question deduplication, and it also has categorization feature to group questions into question categories.

Go through all the existing codebase, keep in mind pdf and png files are dynamic content so no need to read them. I need a document that lets me recreate the whole functionality through agentic coding.\n\ncreate the document in the repository in an md file"}}
